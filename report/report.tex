\paragraph{Introduction}
This is a named paragraph. It starts with the title, which I supplied as
Introduction, and then just continues on in its merry own way.

If I wanted to add another paragraph, then I'd just create an empty line,
and keep on writing. Check out the source to see this in action!

\paragraph{Citations}
Here are some citation tests, just to show how simple the system is to use. 
Again, check the source for more information.

This is a book\cite{book99} reference. This is an article\cite{journal99}
reference. And this is an on-line\cite{website:github-ndts} reference.

For fun, we'll start a new line, and reference the book\cite{book99} again.
